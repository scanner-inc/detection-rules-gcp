  ## Goal
  Detect when a Google Cloud IAM role is created.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor Google Cloud IAM activity audit logs for the invocation of the method:

  * `google.iam.admin.v1.CreateRole`

  ## Triage and response
  1. Investigate the user who created the IAM role and ensure the permissions in the response are scoped properly.
  2. Review the users associated with the role to ensure they should have the attached permissions.
