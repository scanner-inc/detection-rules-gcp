name: Google Cloud Project external principal added as project owner
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect attempts to add an external principal as a project owner in Google Cloud.

  ## Strategy
  This rule monitors Google Cloud Audit Logs for attempts to add an external principal as a project owner. An attacker who has gained initial access may try to maintain access by adding an external principal.

  **Notes:**

  * The rule triggers when a principal with an email address from the domains `gmail.com` or `googlemail.com` is added to a project.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Contact the user or owner of the service account to verify the legitimacy of the action.
  2. If the action is legitimate, consider adding the user or service account to a suppression list.
  3. Otherwise, review the User Investigation dashboard to see if the user or service account has taken other actions.
  4. If the triage indicates the action was taken by an attacker, initiate your company's incident response process and investigate.
