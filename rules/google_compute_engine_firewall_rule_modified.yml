description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when a firewall rule is created, modified, or deleted.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor Google Compute Engine activity audit logs for the following methods:

  * delete a firewall
  * insert a firewall
  * patch a firewall

  ## Triage and response
  1. Review the log and role to ensure proper permissions.
  2. Check the users associated with the role to confirm they should have those permissions.
