name: Google Cloud Storage Bucket enumerated
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when a service account lists GCS buckets.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor GCS bucket admin activity audit logs to identify when a service account invokes the method:
  * `storage.buckets.list`

  ## Triage and response
  Determine whether the service account should be making list bucket calls.
  * If the account was compromised, secure it and investigate the compromise and any unauthorized activity.
  * If the service account owner intended to make the list buckets call, evaluate the necessity of the call, as it could pose a security risk. If it's unnecessary, adjust the rule's filter to stop generating signals for this account.
